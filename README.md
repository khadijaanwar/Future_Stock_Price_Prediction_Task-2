# ðŸ“ˆ Future Stock Price Prediction

This project uses historical stock market data to predict future stock prices using machine learning. It demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling techniques.

## ðŸ§  Features

- Historical stock data visualization
- Feature extraction (e.g., moving averages, RSI)
- Predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms
- Evaluation of model performance

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure

- `Future_Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the complete analysis and prediction workflow.

## ðŸ›  Requirements

Make sure to install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn yfinance
```

## ðŸš€ Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/future-stock-price-prediction.git
cd future-stock-price-prediction
```

2. Launch the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Future_Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb
```

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load data, train models, and view predictions.
